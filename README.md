## 📌 About

**QuickMDCapture** is an Android app that lets you *instantly save notes in Markdown format* from the notification panel or via widgets.

💡 The idea: capture a thought in just a couple of seconds without breaking your flow — whether you’re reading a book, working, or chatting.

Originally built for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), but works with any other app that supports `.md` files.
